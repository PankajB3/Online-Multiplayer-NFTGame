## Use of phaser in project
The config object is how you configure your Phaser Game. There are lots of options that can be placed in this object and as you expand on your Phaser knowledge you'll encounter more of them. But in this tutorial we're just going to set the renderer, dimensions and a default Scene.

The type property can be either Phaser.CANVAS, Phaser.WEBGL, or Phaser.AUTO. This is the rendering context that you want to use for your game. The recommended value is Phaser.AUTO which automatically tries to use WebGL, but if the browser or device doesn't support it it'll fall back to Canvas. The canvas element that Phaser creates will be simply be appended to the document at the point the script was called, but you can also specify a parent container in the game config should you wish.

The width and height properties set the size of the canvas element that Phaser will create. In this case 800 x 600 pixels. Your game world can be any size you like, but this is the resolution the game will display in.
